/*  outline of code and how it works
 *  Before everything...
 *    Load the libraries to make everything work.
 *    Define the pins to interact with the radio and potentiometers.
 *    Create the radio object.
 *    Make a bunch of global variables because i can.
 *  Setup time...
 *    Set the pins to output.
 *    Startup the radio.
 *    Begin the serial communications for moral support.
 *  Looping around...
 *    Check the potentiometer readings.
 *    If the steering reading is different, run the transmission function.
 *    If the speed reading is different, run the transmission function.
 *    If a few seconds have passed without change, run the transission function.
 *    Otherwise continue counting.
 *  End of loop, return to the beginning of the loop.
 *
 *  Transmission function
 *    Turn on the onboard LED.
 *    Create a trannsmission packet buffer.
 *    Insert steering potentiometer reading into the transmission buffer.
 *    Insert speed potentiometer reading into the transission buffer.
 *    Take the old transmission number and ?re-add it to the transmission buffer?
 *    Send the packet of data.
 *    Run the receive function.
 *      Create a buffer to receive the data.
 *      Print the data received through the serial moral support output.
 *      Serial print if there's an error or problem.
 *    Turn off the onboard LED.
 *    Increase the transmission number.
 * 
 *
 *  TO DO
 *  actually do something with received errors.
 *  add in some fancy transmission number checking stuff.
 *  put in a buzzer or another neopixel to display errors for/from the transmitter.
 *  try it out in the real world.
 *  share it with people?
